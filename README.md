The objective of this project is to build a Streamlit dashboard that highlights demographic changes in the US from 2010 to 2023 using data collected from the US Census Bureau API. The dashboard will provide an interactive visualization of the demographic makeup of cities across the US over time, focusing on 7+ demographic variables.
